# In the map, empty space is, unsurprisingly, represented by a space in the map string.
# Any other character represents a wall.  The character used for the wall tells the 
# class what texture to use for the wall.
#
# The "dash" at the end represents the end of the current map row.
#
# The map string should be the same aspect ratio as the screen (in the case of this 
# game, 16:9).  In other words, the screen resolution width divided by number of columns 
# should equal the screen resolution height divided by number of rows.  There are zero
# checks for this, so be careful designing maps.
